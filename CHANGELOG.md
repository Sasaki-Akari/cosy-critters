### version scheme
`overhaul.feature.hotfix`
- **overhaul** number is increased when significant parts of code are replaced or introduced
- **feature** number is increased when a new feature is added, and resets after an overhaul
- **hotfix** number is increased when something minor is tweaked or a bug is fixed, and resets after a new feature

this mimics the version scheme used by minecraft between 2011 and 2024.

# v0.2.0
###### Dec 9, 2025
- added mc-21.11 support
- added bird flying behaviour
  - very configurable - let me know if you find good settings!
  - flocking with standard boids alignment, cohesion, and separation rules
  - will steer towards the ground when high up
  - will steer away from blocks or land on them if approaching from above
  - will land after a configurable period

  - can now perch anywhere instead of pre-defined blocks
  - will favor locations higher up

- tweaked bird flying animation to allow for periods of gliding
- fixed critters spawning in non-overworld dimensions
- refactors and code changes:
  - replaced Yet Another Config Library with the config screen functionality already present in the base game
  - reverted implementation of `ParticleGroup`/`ParticleLimit` due to changes in mc 21.9 making it impossible to create multiple groups with the same limit value, leading to confusing config behaviour
  - replaced modstitch with split build scripts

# v0.1.2
###### Oct 12, 2025
- support minecraft 21.9
- tweak default particle limits
- fix birds spawning near other entities and flying away repeatedly

# v0.1.1
###### Sep 6, 2025

- fix birds getting stuck on blocks
- birds will now react to all entities and block updates

  - accessible via `/cosycritters` command or mod menu

- add directional sprites: birds now visually face left or right depending on the direction theyre flying
- replace particle tracking with minecraft's built in `ParticleGroup`s
